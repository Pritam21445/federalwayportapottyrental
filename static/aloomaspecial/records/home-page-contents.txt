About Us<h2>
You Have Enough to Worry About. Here’s the deal. We didn't start Federalway Porta Potty Rental because we have a deep, lifelong passion for portable sanitation.
We started it because we got tired of seeing it done poorly.
We've been on the other side—as event planners, construction foremen, and party hosts. We've dealt with the late deliveries, the questionable cleanliness, and the surprise fees. We know the sinking feeling of realizing the one thing you really need for your guests or crew to be comfortable is the one thing that's about to become a major problem.
So we built the solution. Federalway Porta Potty Rental is our obsession with logistics, cleanliness, and customer service, aimed at one simple goal: to take this one, crucial item completely off your worry list.
